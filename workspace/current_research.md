# Current Research Status

## Active Industry: Banking
- **Status**: Phase 2 - Technical Profiling - Ready to Start
- **Start Date**: 2025-01-24
- **Sequential Workflow**: FIXED - Using proper agent coordination
- **Geographic Scope**: Canada only

## Phase 1 Results (Previous Discovery - To Be Refined)
- Previous agent did comprehensive analysis instead of just discovery
- Need to extract source inventory for proper sequential workflow
- 47 sources identified but need proper categorization for next phases

## Sequential Workflow Status
- **Phase 1**: Source Discovery - COMPLETE (but needs refinement for handoff)
- **Phase 2**: Technical Profiling - READY TO START
- **Phase 3**: Coverage Analysis - WAITING
- **Phase 4**: Specialized Analysis - WAITING

## Current Activity
- Ready to launch source-technical-profiler with corrected scope
- Will focus on Priority 1-2 sources only (top 10-15)
- Previous comprehensive research archived as reference
