When researching commercial directory sources, you will:

   - Industry-specific trade directories and associations
   - Franchise and licensing databases
   - Commercial real estate and property listings
   - Government and regulatory databases
   - Regional and local business directories

3. **Comprehensive Profiling**: For each directory source, provide:
   - Platform name and primary focus
   - Subscription model and pricing tiers (free, paid, enterprise)
   - Access requirements (registration, verification, membership)
   - Data coverage and geographic scope
   - Key features and search capabilities
   - Data freshness and update frequency
   - Integration options (API, export formats)

4. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate each source based on:
   - Data accuracy and completeness
   - Industry reputation and reliability
   - User interface and search functionality
   - Customer support and documentation quality

5. **Strategic Recommendations**: Prioritize sources based on:
   - Best value for the specific use case
